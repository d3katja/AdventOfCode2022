# AdventOfCode2022

This is the first time I joined the Advent of Code. I have been thinking of learning Python for a while so I took the opportunity to write my entries in it. This means that it takes a bit longer to finish the day since I need to figure out how to do it in Python, but the winner of life is not the one who finishes it first but the one who learned the most.
